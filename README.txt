HOW TO USE
The 'parameters' file is where you enter the parameters of the qubit you want to simulate. The example parameters.txt file has a set of such parameters used in an actual qubit.

The main script asks you a series of questions to specify what type(s) of decoherence and noise you want, and what form(s) you want the output to be in.

The initializer script allows you to initialize a qubit manually, starting in the |0] state, and using sigma-x, sigma-y, and sigma-z operators

The qubitViewer script allows you to plot various characteristics of the qubit against ranges of certain parameters.

TO FIX
 - When the qubit is initialized at halfway between |0] and |1] and only dissipation is used, the state still dephases
 - Initializing the qubit halfway between |0] and |1] puts and moves the vector along the xz plane, but initializing it at |1] makes it move along the yz plane
 - The bloch sphere animation will throw a warning and an error. It still works but it's annoying.
 - The initializer will only show you the Bloch sphere the first time, but not for any subsequent operations

TO DO
 - Add more sweeps to qubitViewer
 - Restructure the initializer as a function that the simulation calls so that it can use the final state
 - Add more parameter sets to the parameters.txt file
 - Replace the current Hamiltonian with the more complete JC hamiltonian (it currently throws a variety of errors when used)
 - FINAL GOAL: Add in a mode that simulates a driving pulse leading into Rabi oscillations

CHANGELOG
7/19/2021:
 - Fixed the qubit setting its Ej value to the specified Ec value (whoops)
 - Moved the eigenstate plot to a separate python file 'qubitViewer' and added other plot options
 - Renamed the parameters txt file to 'example parameters' and made a new 'parameters' file that the other scripts read from
 - Added an 'initializer' script that allows user to set up a qubit state manually for the main script to use

7/15/2021:
 - User can now specify a name for the sphere animation file
 - Printing the expectation values now works
 - Script now indicates to the user when the sphere animation has been saved
 - Re-added driving (it simply sums a creation and destruction operator to the hamiltonian, as per a piece of qutip example code)
 - Added objects for the resonator and hilbert space (setup for parameter sweeps)
 - Can now plot eigenstates
