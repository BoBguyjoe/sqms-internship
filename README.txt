HOW TO USE
The 'parameters' file is where you enter the parameters of the qubit you want to simulate. The example parameters.txt file has a set of such parameters used in an actual qubit.

main.py is the simulation. It initializes a qubit that you can apply dissipation and/or a drive pulse to to see what happens

sweeps.py sweeps over a range of amplitudes and/or lengths of pulses and outputs what are called Rabi oscillations
 - The 'sample' variable determines how many points to measure. Doing a 2D sweep takes quite some time, with only a value of 50 taking several minutes

CHANGELOG
8/2/2021:
 - Added a 2D rabi sweep to sweeps.py, where it sweeps amplitude and length at the same time
 - Fixed up which expectation values main.py plots (having a drive and noise makes it behave unexpectedly)
 - Added capability for gaussian pulse
 - Removed dephasing from main.py (wasn't in the focus, but may add back in later)

7/30/2021:
 - Folded the single drive pulse changing the state to the main simulation
 - Folded the pulse sweep "experiment" to qubitViewer
 - Added Bloch sphere animation to the rabi oscillations sweep
 - Renamed 'qubitViewer' to 'sweeps'

7/29/2021:
 - Added a 'pulse.py' file that collects a bunch of state measurements of a qubit when driven by a square pulse of varying length.

7/23/2021:
 - Switched to the JC hamiltonian in the rotating frame
 - Corrected the various operators to be tensor products, so that they actually act on the right parts of the system
 - The default hamiltonian is the first and third terms of this JC hamiltonian. Driving adds in the usual second term
 - Fixed bug that would prevent the simulation from using calculated Tphi value
 - The initializer has been removed for the time being (until I fix it or decide to cut it)

7/20/2021:
 - Moved the initializer script into the simulation script
 - Fixed initializer only showing bloch sphere plot once
 - Added pulse script, which is start of the rabi oscillations simulation (not for use)
 - Added transition energies plot to qubitViewer (will hopefully be helpful for the rabi oscillator pulse)

7/19/2021:
 - Fixed the qubit setting its Ej value to the specified Ec value (whoops)
 - Moved the eigenstate plot to a separate python file 'qubitViewer' and added other plot options
 - Renamed the parameters txt file to 'example parameters' and made a new 'parameters' file that the other scripts read from
 - Added an 'initializer' script that allows user to set up a qubit state manually for the main script to use

7/15/2021:
 - User can now specify a name for the sphere animation file
 - Printing the expectation values now works
 - Script now indicates to the user when the sphere animation has been saved
 - Re-added driving (it simply sums a creation and destruction operator to the hamiltonian, as per a piece of qutip example code)
 - Added objects for the resonator and hilbert space (setup for parameter sweeps)
 - Can now plot eigenstates
